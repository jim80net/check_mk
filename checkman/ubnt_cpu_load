description:
 This check measures the CPU load average via SNMP on Ubiquity device.

 The daemon sends a 1, 5 and 15 minute average of the CPU load.
 The 15 minute value is checked against a warning and a critical level.
 Since the SNMP MIB does not contain information about the number
 of CPUs this check assumes only one CPU to be present. Thatfore
 the warn/crit levels are interpreted as {absolute} values - not
 as values {per cpu} (like the in agent based load check).

examples:
 # Set CPU load levels for all SNMP devices to 10.0 and 20.0
 check_parameters += [
    ( (10.0, 20.0), [ "snmp" ], ALL_HOSTS, [ "CPU load" ] ),
 ]

perfdata:
 Three values: the load average of the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

inventory:
 If the needed information is available via SNMP one service
 for the target host will be created.

[parameters]
warning (float): The 15 minute average load that triggers a warning
critical (float): The level for the critical state

[configuration]
cpuload_default_levels(float, float): The default levels for all CPU load checks. This is
  preset to {(5, 10)}.
